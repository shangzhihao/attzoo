# Attentions

Attentions is a modular attention-focused toolkit for Python projects. It bundles
reusable primitives, configuration helpers, and reference implementations that
work across classical machine learning and deep learning workflows.

## Key Capabilities

- Provides attention building blocks under `src/attentions`, designed for reuse.
- Ships with type-hinted APIs and rich docstrings for automatic documentation.
- Integrates cleanly with modern Python tooling such as `uv`, `ruff`, and `mypy`.

## Getting Started

```bash
uv run -m mkdocs serve
```

Open the served site in a browser to explore guides and the auto-generated API
reference. Update docstrings as you evolve the library to keep the reference
pages accurate.
